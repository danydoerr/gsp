Synthetic evolution
-------------------

first organism (biological sequences): 10 proteins with 54 aa (average)
height of tree: 10.00, Speciations: 5
Gene duplication rate: 0.00, transloc. Dupl.: 0.50
Gene loss rate: 0.00
Inversion rate: 0.00, max. Inversion group size: 5.00, inverted Translocation: 0.10
Translocation rate: 0.00, max. Translocation group size: 5.00


something interesting is happening here...
