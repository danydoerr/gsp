Synthetic evolution
-------------------

first organism (biological sequences): 9 proteins with 34 aa (average)
height of tree: 10.00, Speciations: 5
Gene duplication rate: 0.00, transloc. Dupl.: 0.50
Gene loss rate: 0.00
Inversion rate: 0.00, max. Inversion group size: 5.00, inverted Translocation: 0.10
Translocation rate: 0.00, max. Translocation group size: 5.00


something interesting is happening here...
time 0.0000: speciation event of organism 1 to organism 2
time 3.0349: insertion of length 2 in org/gene 1/3
time 4.7775: speciation event of organism 1 to organism 3
time 6.0010: speciation event of organism 2 to organism 4
time 9.2848: speciation event of organism 2 to organism 5
time 6.9061: deletion of length 1 in org/gene 1/4
time 5.6979: insertion of length 2 in org/gene 1/5
time 9.6112: deletion of length 1 in org/gene 3/5
time 9.8597: deletion of length 1 in org/gene 4/7
